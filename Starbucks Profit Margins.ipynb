Finding the average profit amongst all drinks and calculating the lower boundary for outliers will be the basis of determining whether or not a drink should be removed from the menu. Potentially, an additional feature can be added recording the popularity of certain drinks that may affect whether it should be removed from the menu or not as to maintain customer
